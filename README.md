A simple example Pebble project demonstrating how to use the 
[`Draw Commands`](https://developer.getpebble.com/docs/c/Graphics/Draw_Commands/) 
API to load and display a vector file in the Pebble Drawing Commands format.

See the [`cards-example`](https://github.com/pebble-examples/cards-example) 
repository for a similar example as well as tools to create PDC vector files.
